# Auto_Nickname_Combiner
This Python project generates unique, creative nicknames by mixing letters from any part of the user's name. It supports different styles (Short, Fun, Formal) and enhances results with emojis, symbols, and numbers. The generated nicknames are displayed cleanly and saved in nicknames.txt for later use.
